Must provide a lockup periods file (--lockup), a vesting periods file (--vesting), or both.
If both files are given, they must describe schedules for the same total amount.
If one file is omitted, it will default to a schedule that immediately unlocks or vests the entire amount.
The described amount of coins will be transferred from the --from address to the vesting account.
Unvested coins may be "clawed back" by the funder with the clawback command.
Coins may not be transferred out of the account if they are locked or unvested, but may be staked.
Staking rewards are subject to a proportional vesting encumbrance.

A periods file is a JSON object describing a sequence of unlocking or vesting events,
with a start time and an array of coins strings and durations relative to the start or previous event.

Usage:
  osmosisd tx vesting create-clawback-vesting-account [to_address] [flags]

Examples:
Sample period file contents:
{
  "start_time": 1625204910,

    },
    {
      "coins": "10test",
      "length": 2592000 // 30 days
    }
  ]
}
